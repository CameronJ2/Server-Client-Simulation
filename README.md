# Server-Client Simulation

## Description 
	This project was created as an assignment for my Operating Systems Course. It's 
    a three-part project. Part 1 consists of simulating system calls from a client,
    or multiple clients, to a server using FIFOs. Part two expands on the first by
    adding a semaphore simulation system call. Part 3 finishes by creating a
    message-passing facility between clients using the server.

## Quick Start
    - The shell scripts were compiled from the C code using GCC, so if you want to
        edit the code, make sure you recompile the script.
    - Create a tmp folder in the current working directory. This is where the
        FIFOs will be generated.
    - Run the server shell script for a particular part.
    - Run the corresponding client shell script for that part.
